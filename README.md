# VideoTranscribe

## Tagline
Making YouTube videos accessible to everyone.

## Project Overview
VideoTranscribe is a project designed to aid individuals with hearing impairments by transcribing YouTube videos and providing concise summaries. By transforming audio content into text, it ensures that everyone can access and understand video content.

## Features
- **Transcription:** Converts the audio from YouTube videos into text.
- **Summarization:** Provides a brief summary of the video content.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple interface for users to input YouTube video URLs and receive transcripts and summaries.

## Problem it Solves
People with hearing impairments often face difficulties accessing the audio content of YouTube videos. VideoTranscribe solves this problem by converting audio into readable text and generating summaries for quick understanding.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Ensuring the accuracy of transcriptions, especially with diverse accents and background noises.
- Creating concise and meaningful summaries from extensive video content.
- Efficiently handling videos of varying lengths and qualities.

## Technologies We Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for backend scripting and data processing.
- **Huggingface:** Utilized for pre-trained models to perform transcription and summarization tasks.
- **SpeechRecognition:** For converting audio content into text.
- **NLTK:** For natural language processing tasks.

## Usage
**Clone the repository:**
bash
Copy code
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/VideoTranscribe.git
cd VideoTranscribe
**Install the required packages:**
bash
Copy code
- pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook YouTube_Video_Summarization_with_Hugging_Face_ASR.ipynb to download the audio, transcribe it, and generate a summary.
