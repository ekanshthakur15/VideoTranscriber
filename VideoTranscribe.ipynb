              "\" ergreat news i've just heard the best newsi just went on twitter-dot net and it turns out according to many a music fan over there i am sexiust i'm not even rn had no idea iwas being such a sexi reviewboy sexius reviewer without even going for it is just like such an incredible accalaid that didn't didn't reallygenerallyooosxareyou sureohturns out i'm not the sexiust reviewer turns out i'm a sexus revieweryes online the discourse is discoursing once again ataking shape in very interesting ways around the reviewsmost recently when it's come to takesave had around a couple of recent albums this year on the new taylor-swift lp the tortured poets department and two the recent gracy abrums album the secret of usone who due to her songwriting style and the taylor-swift feature packed into that record i referred to as kind of taylorswift's baby creativeagain her songs are very derivative of miss swift's tunes her vocals so pretty much lord ripoffonce again haven't really heard somebody out there in the mainstream that is  blatent of a copy cat since gradivanlylike her musical style and vocal style is very provably deribative and seems even care that's the case especially given that the production on her latest record is packed with producers and collaborators that taylorswift is known for orimeathat's just proof of how strong the taylor-swift economy is right nowshe can basically dolaby cardy style move and pick out some other artists woareessentially just ripping him off completelybringing ohinginteresting to table in the process and just by virtue of endorsement those artists kind ofcontinually blow upi ean new record of gracis is her most commercially successful snot really aarguing against taylorswift bumpyery my criticisms of this record and its very plain-faced mediaocrityav bof course with calls of sexismyes the reason i don't like this underwhelming boring o average and en album is because i just inherently have something against womenlook let me sidebar here and explicitly say the point of this video isn't to laugh off the idea of sexism especially when it comes to the music industry where there is still provaa lot of sexism outi don't think there would be as many rap cells out there freaking out and getting all-up in arms over the fact that i enjoy lot of sexireds muic of not for sexismbecause a lot of those same guys listen to ery hedenistic rudamentary filthy raunche rap music bangers made byjuds and hey're completely happy withitotally fine iitbut when sexi red or an artist at isn't meant to appeal to them as a young maleographich all of a sudden it's wrong it's horrible it's the worst thing in the world what are you doing how could you possibly enjoy yof course sexism is an issue in the music industry i would like totake a moment here to talk about the waywhih taylorswifts fan-base and many fanbases that are adjacent to that fanbasind of weaponize  claim in order to sort of just cast-off criticism of taylor swift ining sheoesbecause if there's any sexism going one isal being engaged in btaylor-swift fan bas that's making these claimsmany of them seem broadly ignorant to the wider world of women artists outthere in the music world because they don't really dig deeper into the wealth of womenartists outhere makin a variety of different kinds of musicand don't really seem to feel like they need to because they're kind of listeing toeultimate women the alphawomen and they sort of falselysher is like a barometer fore well-being of all women when inactuality that's insane that's sort of like using the stock market is proof of like how well everybody in the country is doing financiallyjust because you have one lady who is at a peak of her career commercially n financially and selling out tours and just getting tons of attention on her latest record and rye just because you have thtit doesn't mean that women in the music industry broadly are doing ok nor does it mean that when you criticize taylor-swift's music orwashi releases it and repeatedly shoves it down people's throats that you're criticizing and attacking all women especially considering many fans are kind of like pointing these issues out an how their commercial detriment of taylor's female contemporaries like charli and belilish but ye at the end of the dafeel tk thisis a weardeflection of the ways in which capitalism can kind of co-opt social movements especially when hose social movements and up kind of being adopted by those who tend to be doing very well in the capitalist system visavi again taylor swift with her supposed adherence to feminism which loan behold really only focuses at the end of the day on her personal success as a woman  the success of women broadly as a demographicat the end of the day igen if we talk about a bunch of artists who are like pretty accessible in terms of mainstream are somewhat mainstream popularity these rapid fans defending taylor-swift against all sexus criticism being thrown at her they're not listeing to charliexaks they'are probably en barely listening duelipa very few of them likely care for the well-being and success of bilish of bands like boygeus if they 've heard amitski song in the past three days it was probably ipassing on tictakin facwhen isee the discourse around many a taylor-swift twitter account on the internet often these other artists are posed as like competition that taylor has to thwort commercially that like their popularity and success and well-being are like a threat-totaylorimeastandom discourse on the internet can get kind of toxic sometimes but cm the fuck onthis is ridiculous and it feels crazy for me to have to say  a godi ke feminist any way whsoevertiis t how you do feminist advocacy and honestly oure wattering the term down and diminishing its meaning by using it as a weapon to protect your favorite artists that you like because you probably haven't dug that deeply into a wholotordifferent artist an genadefend an arts that you like because theyre being criticized for making mediocr music like the non-sexist thg to do would bto hold thatartist to a level of scrutiny that yowould any other artspecifically mewhich if we're going by that metric imean honestly i am prettbecause the proof that is truly in-the putiwhewe look at my scores when e look at my most negative reviews e ot
